   - To create a new deck with cards, provide a JSON object with the following structure:
     ```json
     {
       "action": "create_deck_with_cards",
       "deck": {
         "deck_name": "Name of the deck",
         "description": "Description of the deck"
       },
       "cards": [
         {
           "front_content": "Front of card 1",
           "back_content": "Back of card 1"
         },
         {
           "front_content": "Front of card 2",
           "back_content": "Back of card 2"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

     {
       "action": "add_deck",
       "deck_name": "Name of the deck",
       "description": "Description of the deck"
     }
     ```
   - To add multiple cards to an existing deck:
     ```json
     {
       "action": "add_cards",
       "deck_id": "ID of the deck",
       "cards": [
         {
           "front_content": "Front of card 1",
           "back_content": "Back of card 1"

           "back_content": "Back of card 2"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```
   - To add a single card to existing deck:

     {
       "action": "add_card",
       "front_content": "Front content of the card",
       "back_content": "Back content of the card",
       "deck_id": "ID of the deck"
     }
